<h1>
Where did this data come from?
</h1>

<p class="section-intro">
  <em>Short answer</em>: we combine data from any useful online sources
  you can tell us about, official and unofficial.
  <br>
  <em>Longer (technical) answer</em>: if you’re happy to read code, you can look in
  the file <code>instructions.json</code> for the complete details — see
  <a href="#instructions-json">more about this below</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We list the sources we’re using at the bottom of each term’s page
  (for example, see “Main sources” right at the bottom of 
  <a href="http://everypolitician.org/kenya/assembly/term-table/11.html">Kenya’s National Assembly’s 11th term</a>).
</p>
<p>
  We rebuild the data from those sources whenever we know the data in them
  has itself changed.
</p>


<h2>About those sources</h2>

<p>
  We aggregate from lots of difference online sources: official parliament sites,
  unofficial sites (including wikipedia’s <a href="https://www.wikidata.org">WikiData</a>).
  <!-- FIXME: more about how this works-->
  If you know of a good source that we’re not using:
  <a href="/contribute.html">let us know</a>!
</p>
<p>
  We merge our data from multiple sources because this isn’t a straightforward
  problem: a data source might be very reliable, but not timely. It might be
  up-to-date and reliable, but not include dates of birth, which another source
  does have. Unofficial sites might be less authoritative but are often more
  timely or complete. The fact is that no country has a single, authoritative
  source which is complete and up-to-date, which is the primary reason we
  created EveryPolitician project in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  The data sources available vary immensely from country to country. And the
  best people to ask for the best data sources are the locals: so if you know
  of a good source that we’re not using in <em>your</em> country, let us know!
  Just pointing out a source to us is helpful; you don’t have to do the hard
  work of actually extracting the data (although if you’re a dev...
  <a href="/scrapers.html">you can help</a>).

<h2 id="the_technical_details">The technical details</h2>
<p>
  You can see <em>exactly</em> where the data’s coming from by looking in the
  <a href="https://github.com/everypolitician/everypolitician-data/">EveryPolitician data repo</a>.
  Specifically, you want the <code>sources</code> directory for the legislature
  you’re interested in. Look inside the <code>instructions.json</code> there
  because that is the file EveryPolitician uses to rebuild its data whenever
  something changes.
</p>
<p>
  For example, the instructions (containing the explicit sources as well as
  indications of how to process them) that EveryPolitician follows for putting
  together its data for Kenya’s Assembly are in this
  <a href="https://github.com/everypolitician/everypolitician-data/blob/master/data/Kenya/Assembly/sources/instructions.json"><code>instructions.json</code> file</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Amongst other things, that file tells you the <em>type</em> of data it’s
  getting as well as URL of the <em>resource</em>. It’s common for the resource
  itself to be the output of a process that is getting data from the “raw”
  source — for example, in the case of Kenya, two of the sources (one for
  determining the terms available, and another for the politicians’ names)
  are the output of a single webscraper that’s running here:
  <a href="https://morph.io/tmtmtmtm/kenya-mzalendo">morph.io/tmtmtmtm/kenya-mzalendo</a>.
  That scraper itself is getting data from the 
  <a href="http://info.mzalendo.com">Mzalendo website</a>, which you can see by looking at
  <a href="https://github.com/tmtmtmtm/kenya-mzalendo/blob/master/scraper.rb#L75">the scraper code</a>.
